/**
 * This is the interface for the implementing class which acts as a "listener" to all Order Handler events.
 * The listener must be registered with Order Handler in the following manner:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     OrderHandlerListener listener = new OrderHandlerListenerSample();
 *     OrderHandler orderHandler = new OrderHandler(listener);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * Order Handler communicates its events to the API user by invoking the appropriate methods of the object which
 * implements this interface. These invocations run in the API thread (as opposed to the user thread). More formally,
 * the interaction model follows the request/response paradigm, where the requests and the responses are asynchronous
 * relative to each other.
